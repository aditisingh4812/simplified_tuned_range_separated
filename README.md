# Simplified Tuned Range Separated

This initiative offers practical guidance on implementing the Simplified Tuned Range-Separated Functional (STRSF). The methodology is demonstrated through the try_urslf GitHub repository, which hosts a customized extension of the PySCF computational chemistry framework. Within this repository, users will find dedicated modules for both restricted and unrestricted calculations, tailored explicitly for optimizing the Ï‰_eff parameter in range-separated hybrid functionals.

# Repository Overview:
The give_arxiv_details repository archives computational workflows and raw data supporting the figures and tables in the associated paper. It includes:

Input/output files from quantum chemistry packages (NWChem and Q-Chem) for reproducibility.

Calculation details for transparency and peer validation.

Separately, the geom repository houses all molecular geometries (optimized structures) used in the study, ensuring seamless reconstruction of the paperâ€™s computational experiments.
