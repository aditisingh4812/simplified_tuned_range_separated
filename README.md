# Simplified Tuned Range Separated

This initiative offers practical guidance on implementing the Simplified Tuned Range-Separated Functional (STRSF). The methodology is demonstrated through the try_urslf GitHub repository, which hosts a customized extension of the PySCF computational chemistry framework. Within this repository, users will find dedicated modules for both restricted and unrestricted calculations, specifically tailored for optimizing the Ï‰ (omega) parameter in range-separated hybrid functionals.

# Repository Overview:
The give_arxiv_details repository archives computational workflows and raw data supporting the figures and tables in the associated paper. It includes:

Input/output files from quantum chemistry packages (NWChem and Q-Chem) for reproducibility.

Calculation details for transparency and peer validation.

Separately, the geom repository houses all molecular geometries (optimized structures) used in the study, ensuring seamless reconstruction of the paperâ€™s computational experiments.
